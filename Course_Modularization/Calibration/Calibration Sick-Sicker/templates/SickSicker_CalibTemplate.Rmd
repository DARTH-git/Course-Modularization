# 00  Calibration Specifications 

Model: Sick-Sicker 4-state Markov Model

Inputs to be calibrated: p_S1S2, hr_S1, hr_S2

Targets: Surv, Prev, PropSick

Calibration method: 

Goodness-of-fit measure: Sum of Log-Likelihood

# 01 Load packages

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
if (!require('pacman')) install.packages('pacman'); library(pacman) # use this package to conveniently install other packages
# load (install if required) packages from CRAN
p_load("lhs", "plotrix", "psych", "scatterplot3d")  
# install_github("DARTH-git/darthtools", force = TRUE) Uncomment if there is a newer version
p_load_gh("DARTH-git/darthtools")
```

# 02 Load target data

```{r}
# your turn
