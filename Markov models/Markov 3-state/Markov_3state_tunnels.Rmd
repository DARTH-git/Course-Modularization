# 04 Define and initialize matrices and vectors

## 04.1 Cohort trace

```{r}
m_M <- matrix(NA, 
              nrow = n_t + 1,  # create Markov trace (n_t + 1 because R doesn't understand 
                               # Cycle 0)
              ncol = n_s_td,                  
              dimnames = list(0:n_t, v_n_td)) 

# The cohort starts as healthy
# initialize first cycle of Markov trace accounting for the tunnels
m_M[1, ] <- c(1, rep(0, tunnel_size), 0)     
```

## 04.2 Transition probability array

```{r}
# create the transition probability array
a_P <- array(0,                                          # Create 3-D array
             dim = c(n_s_td, n_s_td, n_t),               
             dimnames = list(v_n_td, v_n_td, 0:(n_t-1)))  
```

Fill in the transition probability array:

```{r}
# from Healthy
a_P["Healthy", "Healthy", ]  <- 1 - p_HD - p_HS
a_P["Healthy", "Sick_1Yr", ] <- p_HS
a_P["Healthy", "Dead", ]     <- p_HD

# from Sick
for(i in 1:(tunnel_size - 1)){ 
  a_P[Sick_tunnel[i], Sick_tunnel[i + 1], ] <- 1 - p_SD[i]
  a_P[Sick_tunnel[i], "Dead", ] <- p_SD[i]
}

a_P[Sick_tunnel[tunnel_size], Sick_tunnel[tunnel_size], ] <- 1 - p_SD[tunnel_size]
a_P[Sick_tunnel[tunnel_size], "Dead", ] <- p_SD[tunnel_size]

# from Dead
a_P["Dead", "Dead", ] <- 1
```

## 04.3 Check if transition array and probabilities are valid

```{r}
# Check if transition matrix is valid (i.e., each row should add up to 1)
valid <- apply(a_P, 3, function(x) sum(rowSums(x))==n_s_td)
if (!isTRUE(all.equal(as.numeric(sum(valid)), as.numeric(n_t)))) {
  stop("This is not a valid transition Matrix")
}
```

# 05 Run Markov model

```{r}
for (t in 1:n_t) {                         # loop through the number of cycles
  m_M[t + 1, ] <- m_M[t, ] %*% a_P[, , t]  # estimate the Markov trace for cycle t + 1 
                                           # using the t-th matrix from the 
                                           # probability array 
}
head(m_M, n = 30)
```

Create aggregated trace.

```{r}
m_M_td <- cbind(Healthy = m_M[, "Healthy"], 
                Sick = rowSums(m_M[, 2:(tunnel_size + 1)]), 
                Dead = m_M[, "Dead"])
head(m_M_td) # show the first rows of the aggregated Markov trace
```

# 06 Compute and Plot Epidemiological Outcomes

## 06.1 Cohort trace

```{r}
# create a plot of the data
matplot(m_M_td, type = 'l', 
        ylab = "Probability of state occupancy",
        xlab = "Cycle",
        main = "Cohort Trace", lwd = 2)              
# add a legend to the graph
legend("right", v_n, col = c("black", "red", "green"), lty = 1:3, bty = "n")  
```

## 06.2 Overall Survival (OS)

```{r}
v_os <- 1 - m_M_td[, "Dead"]    # calculate the overall survival (OS) probability
v_os <- rowSums(m_M_td[, 1:2])  # alternative way of calculating the OS probability   

# create a simple plot showing the OS
plot(v_os, type = 'l', 
     ylim = c(0, 1),
     ylab = "Survival probability",
     xlab = "Cycle",
     main = "Overall Survival")             
# add grid 
grid(nx = n_t, ny = 10, col = "lightgray", lty = "dotted", lwd = par("lwd"), equilogs = TRUE) 
```

## 06.2.1 Life Expectancy (LE)

```{r}
v_le <- sum(v_os)           # summing probablity of OS over time  (i.e. life expectancy)
```

## 06.3 Disease prevalence

```{r}
v_prev <- m_M_td[, "Sick"]/v_os
plot(v_prev,
     ylim = c(0, 1),
     ylab = "Prevalence",
     xlab = "Cycle",
     main = "Disease prevalence")
```

# 07 Compute Cost-Effectiveness Outcomes

## 07.1 Mean Costs and QALYs

```{r}
# per cycle
# calculate expected costs by multiplying m_M with the cost vector for the different 
# health states   
v_tc <- m_M_td %*% c(c_H, c_S, c_D)  
# calculate expected QALYs by multiplying m_M with the utilities for the different 
# health states   
v_tu <- m_M_td %*% c(u_H, u_S, u_D)  
```

## 07.2 Discounted Mean Costs and QALYs

```{r}
# Discount costs  by multiplying the cost vector with discount weights (v_dw) 
v_tc_d <-  t(v_tc) %*% v_dwc
# Discount QALYS  by multiplying the QALYs vector with discount weights (v_dw)
v_te_d <-  t(v_tu) %*% v_dwe
```

## 07.3 Results

```{r}
results <- data.frame( "Total Discounted Cost" = v_tc_d, 
                       "Life Expectancy" = v_le, 
                       "Total Discounted QALYs" = v_te_d, 
                       check.names = F)
results
```
