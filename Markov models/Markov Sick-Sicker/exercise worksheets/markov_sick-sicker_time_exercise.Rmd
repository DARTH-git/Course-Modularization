# Exercise I: Variations on the Sick-Sicker Markov Model

Previously, you built a Markov of the Sick-Sicker model where transition probabilities were assumed to be constant over time. In this exercise, you will expand on that model to incorporate age-dependence (time-varying probabilities).

**Age-dependence**

Healthy individuals are no longer assumed to have a fixed mortality rate. Their mortality rate depends on their age. The Human Mortality Database (HMD) (www.mortality.org) provides these age specific mortality rates (Mx1x1). You can load this data in R using different packages, for example the HMDHFplus, demography or data.table package. Registration (free) on the HMD website is required in order to use the data. For this exercise, we provide you with this mortality rate for the US in the file “HMD_USA_Mx_2015.csv”.

Remember: individuals in S1 and S2 still have an increased mortality relative to healthy individuals, as described in the original exercise. The same hazard ratios are used to calculate the probabilities of dying from S1 and S2 in this exercise. 

*Before you start coding this exercise, please create a copy of your code from the original (time-homogeneous) Markov model.*

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F, out.width='100%', fig.cap='Schematic representation of the Sick-Sicker model', fig.align='center'}
if (!require(here)) install.packages('here')
if (!require(knitr)) install.packages('knitr')
include_graphics(here::here("figures", "sick_sicker_diagram.png"))
```

## Tasks

1. Use the `R` function “Functions_markov_sick-sicker.R” and create a copy to then adapt the model to account for age-dependency.

2. Import the mortality rate data the “HMD_USA_Mx_2015.csv” file and store this data in a variable called `v_r_HD`. You could use the following code with dplyr syntax:

```
lt_usa_2005 <- read.csv("HMD_USA_Mx_2015.csv")
v_r_HD <- lt_usa_2005 %>%
  filter(Age >= age & Age <= (max_age-1)) %>%
  select(Total) %>%
  as.matrix()
```

3. Create probability to die when healthy as a function of age: `p_HD <- 1 - exp(- v_r_HD)`  

4. Incorporate the age dependent mortality rate in the model.

5. Create a survival curve of the cohort under no treatment.
Extra challenge: plot the survival curves with and without age-dependent probabilities of death in one graph so you can compare.

*Note: To calculate the probability of dying from S1 and S2, use the hazard ratios provided. To do so, first convert the probability of dying from healthy,`p_HD`, to a rate; then multiply this rate by the appropriate hazard ratio; finally, convert this rate back to a probability. Recall that you can convert between rates and probabilities using the following formulas: $r = -log(1-p)$ and $p = 1-e^{(-rt)}$
