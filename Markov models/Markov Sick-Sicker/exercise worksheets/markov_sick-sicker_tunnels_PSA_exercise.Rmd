# Exercise I: Variations on the Sick-Sicker Markov Model

Previously, you built a Markov of the Sick-Sicker model where transition probabilities were assumed to be constant over time. In this exercise, you will expand on that model to incorporate age-dependence (time-varying probabilities) and history-dependence.

**History-dependence**

It has been recently discovered that the risk of progression from Sick to Sicker increases the longer a person has been sick. This increase follows a Weibull growth curve, calculated as 

$p_{S1S2(t)} = \lambda_\gamma t^{(\gamma-1)}$

where $t$ is the $t$-th cycle (year) that a person has been in the Sick state. $\lambda = 0.08$ and $\gamma = 1.1$ are the scale and shape parameters of the Weibull function, respectively.

We will now expand the age-dependent model to include this history dependence by adding tunnel states for S1, as shown in Figure 2.

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F, out.width='100%', fig.cap='Schematic representation of the Sick-Sicker model', fig.align='center'}
if (!require(here)) install.packages('here')
if (!require(knitr)) install.packages('knitr')
include_graphics(here::here("figures", "sick_sicker_diagram.png"))
```

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F, out.width='100%', fig.cap='Schematic representation of the Sick-Sicker model with tunnels states for S1', fig.align='center'}
if (!require(here)) install.packages('knitr')
if (!require(knitr)) install.packages('knitr')
include_graphics(here::here("figures", "sick_sicker_tunnels_diagram.png"))
```

## Tasks

1. Starting from the age-dependent Markov model in the R function “Markov_Sick-Sicker_time.R”, expand the 3D transition probability array to account for tunnels.

2. Create the parameter `p_S1S2` as a Weibull function as follows:
- `p_S1S2 <- l*g*(1:tunnel_size)^{g-1}`, where 
- `l <- 0.08` (scale)
- `g <- 1.1`  (shape)

3.	Fill in the 3D transition probability array accounting for the tunnel states for S1

4.	Plot the survival curve for the cohort under no treatment. Extra challenge: plot the survival curves for all three Markov model versions (time-homogenous, age-dependent, and history-dependent) in one graph so you can compare.

| - Utility for treated individuals in S1 | `u_trt` |  0.95        |

*Note: To calculate the probability of dying from S1 and S2, use the hazard ratios provided. To do so, first convert the probability of dying from healthy, `p_HD`, to a rate; then multiply this rate by the appropriate hazard ratio; finally, convert this rate back to a probability. Recall that you can convert between rates and probabilities using the following formulas: $r = -log(1-p)$ and $p = 1-e^{(-rt)}$

# Exercise II: Probabilistic sensitivity analysis of the Sick-Sicker Markov model

This exercise continues based on the age-and-history-dependent deterministic Markov model of the Sick-Sicker model from Exercise I. In this exercise, you will do a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) with 1000 simulations `(n_sim)`. The Table describes the distributions for the variables you used in the previous exercise.
