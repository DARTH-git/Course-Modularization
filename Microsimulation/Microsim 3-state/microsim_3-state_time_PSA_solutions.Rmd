# everyone begins in the healthy state (in this example)

```

# 05 Define Simulation Functions

## 05.1 Probability function

The function that updates the transition probabilities of every cycle is shown below.

```{r}
Probs <- function(M_t, df_X, v_Ts) { 
  # Arguments:
    # M_t: health state occupied  at cycle t (character variable)
    # df_X: data frame with individual characteristics data 
    # v_Ts: vector with the duration of being sick
  # Returns: 
    # transition probabilities for that cycle
  
  # create matrix of state transition probabilities
  m_p_t           <- matrix(0, nrow = n_s, ncol = n_i)  
  # give the state names to the rows
  rownames(m_p_t) <-  v_n                               
  
  # lookup baseline probability and rate of dying based on individual characteristics
  p_HD_all <- inner_join(df_X, m_p_HD, by = c("Sex") )
  p_HD     <- p_HD_all[M_t == "healthy", "p_HD"]
  
  # update m_p_t with the appropriate probabilities   
  # transition probabilities when healthy
  m_p_t[, M_t == "healthy"] <- rbind(1 - p_HD - p_HS, p_HS, p_HD)    
  # transition probabilities when sick 
  m_p_t[, M_t == "sick"]    <- rbind(0, 1 - p_SD[v_Ts], p_SD[v_Ts])  
  # transition probabilities when dead     
  m_p_t[, M_t == "dead"]    <- rbind(0, 0, 1)                            
  return(t(m_p_t))
}       
```

## 05.2 Cost function

The `Costs` function estimates the costs at every cycle.

```{r}
Costs <- function (M_t) {
  # M_t: current health state
  c_t <- c()
  c_t[M_t == "dead"]    <- c_D     # costs at dead state
  c_t[M_t == "healthy"] <- c_H     # costs accrued by being healthy this cycle
  c_t[M_t == "sick"]    <- c_S     # costs accrued by being sick this cycle
  
  return(c_t)  # return costs accrued this cycle
}
```

## 05.3 Health outcome function

The `Effs` function to update the utilities at every cycle.

```{r}
Effs <- function (M_t) {
  # M_t: current health state
  q_t <- c() 
  q_t[M_t == "dead"]    <- u_D     # QALYs at dead state
  q_t[M_t == "healthy"] <- u_H     # QALYs accrued by being healthy this cycle
  q_t[M_t == "sick"]    <- u_S     # QALYs accrued by being sick this cycle
  
  return(q_t)  # return the QALYs accrued this cycle
}
```
