```

## 05.1 Probability function

The function that updates the transition probabilities of every cycle is shown below.

```{r}
Probs <- function(M_t, df_X, v_Ts, t) { 
  # Arguments:
    # M_t: health state occupied by individual i at cycle t (character variable)
    # df_X:     data frame with individual characteristics data 
  # v_Ts: time an individual is sick
  # t:     current cycle 
# Returns: 
  #   transition probabilities for that cycle
  
  # create matrix of state transition probabilities  
  m_p_t           <- matrix(0, nrow = n_s, ncol = n_i) 
  rownames(m_p_t) <-  v_n  # give the state names to the rows
  
  # lookup baseline probability and rate of dying based on individual characteristics
  p_HD_all <- inner_join(df_X, p_mort, by = c("Age"))
  p_HD     <- p_HD_all[M_t == "H","p_HD"]
  
  # update the m_p with the appropriate probabilities   
  # transition probabilities when healthy
  m_p_t[, M_t == "H"]  <- rbind(1 - p_HS1 - p_HD, p_HS1, 0, p_HD)                              
  # transition probabilities when sick
  m_p_t[, M_t == "S1"] <- rbind(p_S1H, 1 - p_S1H - p_S1S2 - p_S1D[v_Ts], p_S1S2, p_S1D[v_Ts])  
  # transition probabilities when sicker

  return(t(m_p_t))
}       
```

## 05.2 Cost function

The `Costs` function estimates the costs at every cycle.

```{r}
Costs <- function (M_t, Trt = FALSE) {
  # M_t: health state occupied by individual i at cycle t (character variable)
  # Trt:  is the individual being treated? (default is FALSE)

  c_t[M_t == "H"]  <- c_H                  # update the cost if healthy
  c_t[M_t == "S1"] <- c_S1 + c_Trt * Trt   # update the cost if sick conditional on treatment
  c_t[M_t == "S2"] <- c_S2 + c_Trt * Trt   # update the cost if sicker conditional on treatment
  c_t[M_t == "D"]  <- c_D                  # update the cost if dead
  
  return(c_t)        		                   # return the costs
}
```

## 05.3 Health outcome function

The `Effs` function to update the utilities at every cycle.

```{r}
Effs <- function (M_t, df_X, Trt = FALSE, cl = 1) {
  # M_t: health state occupied by individual i at cycle t (character variable)
  # df_X: data frame with individual characteristics data 
  # Trt:  is the individual treated? (default is FALSE) 
  # cl:   cycle length (default is 1)
  
  u_t <- 0                                 # by default the utility for everyone is zero
  u_t[M_t == "H"]  <- u_H                  # update the utility if healthy
  u_t[M_t == "S1" & Trt == FALSE] <- u_S1  # update the utility if sick
  # update the utility if sick but on treatment (adjust for individual effect modifier) 
  u_t[M_t == "S1" & Trt == TRUE]  <- u_Trt * df_X$x[M_t == "S1"]  
  u_t[M_t == "S2"] <- u_S2                 # update the utility if sicker
  u_t[M_t == "D"]  <- u_D                  # update the utility if dead
