# Exercise I: The Sick-Sicker model – A Markov model 

A hypothetical disease affects individuals with an average age of 25 years and results in increased mortality, increased treatment costs and reduced quality of life. The disease has two levels; affected individuals initially become sick but can subsequently progress and become sicker. Two alternative strategies exist for this hypothetical disease: a no-treatment and a treatment strategy. Under the treatment strategy, individuals who become sick or progress and become sicker receive treatment and continue doing so until they recover or die. The cost of the treatment is additional to the cost of being sick or sicker for one year. The treatment improves quality of life for those individuals who are sick but has no effect on the quality of life of those who are sicker. You are asked to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the treatment.

To model this disease, we will rely on a state-transition cohort model, called the Sick-Sicker model, first described by Enns et al. The Sick-Sicker model consists of four health states: healthy (H), two disease states sick (S1) and sicker (S2) and dead (D) (Figure 1). All individuals start in the healthy state. Over time, healthy individuals may develop the disease and can progress to S1. Individuals in S1 can recover (return to state H), progress further to S2 or die. Individuals in S2 cannot recover (i.e. cannot transition to either S1 or H). Individuals in H are assumed to have a fixed mortality rate and individuals in S1 and S2 have an increased mortality rate compared to healthy individuals. These rates are used to calculate the probabilities to die when in S1 and S2.

*Note: To calculate the probability of dying from S1 and S2, use the hazard ratios provided. To do so, first convert the probability of dying from healthy, `p_HD`, to a rate; then multiply this rate by the appropriate hazard ratio; finally, convert this rate back to a probability. Recall that you can convert between rates and probabilities using the following formulas: $r = -loga(1-p)$ and $p = 1-e^{(-rt)}$
