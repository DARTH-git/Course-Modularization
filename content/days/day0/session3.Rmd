## Model Parameterization and Sensitivity Analysis

Wednesday, November 16, 2022

**Readings:**

- Sensitivity analysis example: TBD


**Schedule:**

|                            |            |
|---------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| 10:00am – 10:30am   | How do we parameterize models? |
| 10:30am – 11:00am  | Break out activity: discuss data needs of fellow modeling projects | 
| 11:00am – 12:00pm | Sensitivity analysis |
| 12:00pm – 12:30pm | R Shiny sensitivity analysis demonstration |


**Learning objectives:**

- Understand how decision analytic models are parameterized
-	Understand how to determine the data needs for a given modeling project
-	Understand the role of deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis
-	Appropriately interpret the results from a sensitivity analysis
