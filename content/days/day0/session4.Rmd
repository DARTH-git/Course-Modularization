Thursday, November 17, 2022

**Readings:**

- Microsimulation example: TBD


**Schedule:**

|                            |            |
|---------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| 10:00am – 11:00am   | Microsimulation modeling |
| 11:00am – 11:15am | Walk-through modeling project outline template (preparation for Part II) | 
| 11:15am – 12:15pm | Break out activity: Complete an modeling project proposal |
| 12:15pm – 12:30pm | Wrap up |


**Learning objectives:**

-	Understand the structure of a microsimulation model
-	Deepen understanding of when to use different types of models
-	Understand the pros and cons of microsimulations versus cohort state-transition models
-	Outline a decision analytic model for a topic of interest
