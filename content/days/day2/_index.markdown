Basic agenda:

- Synchronous session is from 9AM-12PM Central Time and consists of a mix of review, demonstrations and hands-on exercises

**Preparation**:

- [Install OpenTree (10 minutes)](https://decision-modeling-for-public-health-2021.netlify.app/days/day2/intro_to_decision_analysis/)
- [Watch "Cohort State-Transition Models" videos (30 minutes)](https://decision-modeling-for-public-health-2021.netlify.app/days/day2/videos_markov/)

Here is a tentative timetable:

|                            |            |
