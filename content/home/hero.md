This is the website for the *Cost-Effectiveness and Decision Modeling using R Workshop* workshop.

The [Decision Analysis in R for Technologies in Health (DARTH) workgroup](http://darthworkgroup.com/) in collaboration with the University of Minnesota Division of Health Policy and Management is offering a workshop on cost-effectiveness and decision modeling using R, **August 29 â€“ 31, 2022** as a virtual, hands-on seminar. Instructors Eva Enns, Karen Kuntz, Fernando Alarid-Escudero, and other DARTH co-instructors will cover the principles of cost-effectiveness analysis and decision analytic modeling and will guide participants in implementing decision trees, Markov models, and microsimulation models in R as well as how to use models for cost-effectiveness analysis and deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
