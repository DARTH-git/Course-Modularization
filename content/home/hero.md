This is the website for a 5-day hands-on workshop: *Cost-Effectiveness and Decision Modeling using R Workshop*.

The [Decision Analysis in R for Technologies in Health (DARTH) workgroup](http://darthworkgroup.com/) and the [University of Minnesota School of Public Health](https://www.sph.umn.edu/events-calendar/decision-modeling-using-r-workshop/) are jointly offering a workshop on cost-effectiveness and decision modeling in R. The workshop will be **offered virtually via Zoom**. Instructors Eva Enns, Karen Kuntz, Fernando Alarid-Escudero, and other DARTH co-instructors will cover the principles of cost-effectiveness analysis and decision analytic modeling and will guide participants in implementing decision trees, Markov models, and microsimulation models in R as well as how to use models for cost-effectiveness analysis and deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
