Health and public health resources are limited and policymakers are under increased pressure to use these resources as efficiently as possible.  Decision analysis is a quantitative decision-making framework used to formalize objectives, quantify tradeoffs, and ultimately support more informed decision making.  These techniques have been applied to a wide range of health policy questions, including optimal cancer screening and treatment guidelines; technology reimbursement and coverage decisions; and hospital operations management.

**Part I** of this series provides the conceptual foundation of decision modeling and cost-effectiveness analysis as well as R programming. **Part II** is a hands-on programming workshop that will teach participants how to implement foundational models and analyses used in decision analysis, including cohort state-transition models (Markov models), individual-level (microsimulation) models, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. **Part III** of the series is a project workshop, where participants will make progress on their own modeling project topics with individualized support and instructional sessions on more advanced topics, such as model calibration and constructing user-friendly interfaces using R Shiny.  This course employs a balance of formal instruction, self-guided exercises, and follow-up / debrief of the exercises via a series of sessions and consultations delivered by multiple instructors with expertise in the area.  

R is an open-source software that provides a flexible environment where advanced statistical analyses can be combined with decision models of varying complexity within the same framework and the results can be presented in publication ready tabular and graphical forms. The fact that R is freely available also improves model transparency and reproducibility.

*The DARTH workgroup is a multi-institutional, multi-university collaborative effort comprised of researchers who have a passion for transparent and open-source solutions to decision analysis in health. The aim of this collaboration is to expand knowledge and develop educational materials that empower people to construct R-based decision models.
