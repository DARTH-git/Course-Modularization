Economic evaluation often rely on decision models. As decision modelling advances, more complex models are being designed to better represent the underlying clinical condition. In addition, decision models increasingly require new statistical and mathematical techniques, which cannot be easily done in software traditionally used for health economic evaluation. As a consequence, multiple software packages are used in one economic evaluation. This fragmentation of processes can be reduced by switching to the `R` software. 

`R` is a freely available programming environment that can be used to implement, simulate and analysis the results of a health economic evaluation. `R` can facilitate model transparency, reproducibility and shareability, through a number of innovative ways (good coding practice, Markdown, Shiny). However, realizing this potential can be challenging given the lake of expertise and standardized use in the field of health decision analysis, and the famous "steep learning curve" of `R`. Over the past years, a number of groups around the globe have worked, in parallel, on the development of materials to conduct decision modelling in `R`, analyse the results of decision models, improve and harmonize the link between input parameters and decision models as well as standardize the use of `R` in decision analysis.

In this course, participants will learn about the use of `R` in the field of health decision making, its advantages and disadvantages. We start by providing some pre-course material to get familiar with the basics of `R` for health decision modelling. During the rest of the course, participants will learn about the topic below via pre-recorded video's and live demonstration sessions. Throughout the course participants will engage in hands-on programming exercise and the instructors will be available to answer questions.  

Participants will be expected to have experiences with cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), decision modelling methods (e.g. cohort state-transition models (Markov models), individual based state-transition models (microsimulation), sensitivity analysis and a basic understanding of statistics for economic evaluations. 

Participants will need a computer with `R` and `R` studio pre-installed. Participants are also expected to have a stable internet connection and material (e.g. microphone and audio output) to participate in online education. Instructions about the required packages will follow prior to the course. This might require involving the IT department depending on the authorization and admin rights the participants have within the company. 

The materials presented in this workshop were developed by the [Decision Analysis in `R` for Technologies in Health (DARTH) Workgroup](http://darthworkgroup.com/) The DARTH workgroup is a multi-institutional, multi-university collaborative effort comprised of researchers who have a passion for transparent and open-source solutions to decision analysis in health. The aim of this collaboration is to expand knowledge and develop educational materials that empower people to construct `R`-based decision models.
