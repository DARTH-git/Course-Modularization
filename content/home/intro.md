Health and public health resources are limited and policymakers are under increased pressure to use these resources as efficiently as possible. Decision analysis is a quantitative decision-making framework used to formalize objectives, quantify tradeoffs, and ultimately support more informed decision making.  These techniques have been applied to a wide range of health policy questions, including optimal cancer screening and treatment guidelines; technology reimbursement and coverage decisions; and hospital operations management.

Part I of this course provides the conceptual foundation of decision modeling and cost-effectiveness analysis in four synchronous Zoom sessions. At the end of the Part I series, fellows will submit a modeling project idea for instructor feedback and which will be used in the second part of this course. Part II is a series of four hands-on programming synchronous Zoom sessions that will teach participants how to implement foundational models and analyses used in decision analysis in R, including cohort state-transition models (Markov models), individual-level (microsimulation) models, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. During Part II sessions, fellows will implement components of their modeling projects in R during hands-on exercises. This course employs a balance of formal lecture-based instruction, hands-on exercises, and opportunities for synchronous and asynchronous discussions via a series of sessions delivered by multiple instructors with expertise in the area. Fellows should complete the required readings and/or preparation listed prior to each session, including the self-paced “Introduction to R” modules and/or “R Self-Assessment Quiz” prior to Part II to ensure an adequate background in the R programming language.
