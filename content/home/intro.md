Health and public health resources are limited and policymakers are under increased pressure to make use of these resources as efficiently as possible. Decision analysis is a quantitative decision-making framework used to formalize objectives, quantify tradeoffs, and ultimately support more informed decision making. These techniques have been applied to a wide range of health policy questions, including optimal cancer screening and treatment guidelines; technology reimbursement and coverage decisions; and hospital operations management.

`R` is an open-source software that provides a flexible environment where advanced statistical analyses can be combined with decision models of varying complexity within the same framework and the results can be presented in publication-ready tabular and graphical forms. The fact that `R` is freely available also improves model transparency and reproducibility.

The materials presented in this workshop were developed by the [Decision Analysis in `R` for Technologies in Health (DARTH) Workgroup](http://darthworkgroup.com/) The DARTH workgroup is a multi-institutional, multi-university collaborative effort comprised of researchers who have a passion for transparent and open-source solutions to decision analysis in health. The aim of this collaboration is to expand knowledge and develop educational materials that empower people to construct `R`-based decision models. Visit [our website](www.darthworkgroup.com) for more information.

This workshop covers fundamental R skills, models, and analyses used in decision-analytic modeling, including cohort state-transition models (Markov models) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA).
