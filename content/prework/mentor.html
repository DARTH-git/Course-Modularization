<p>Each of you will be assigned to an instructor we will act as a mentor throughout the workshop with the primary responsiblity of helping with your decision model. You should work on your model primarily with your mentor. But of course, if you have general questions you could always reach out to other instructors who will float online throughout the day.</p>
<p><strong>A list of mentor/mentee assignments will be posted here in the near future. Stay tuned!</strong></p>
<p>Once assigned to a mentor, you can <strong>schedule 1:1 meetings</strong> with him/her at both of your convenience. Please make sure you coordinate with your mentor since each mentor has around 2-3 students.</p>
