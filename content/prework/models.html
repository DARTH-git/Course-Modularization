<p>After you go through the tutorials, you can now play with our toy models. They can be found <a href="https://github.com/DARTH-git/2024-DARTH-Advanced-Workshop">here</a> in the folder “Sample models”.</p>
<p>In addition, for those who are more advanced, you can check out a complete exmaple model that we developed in the folder “Model framework.” This is a full decision analysis that adheres to the decision model framework that we developed. The details of this framework is in the paper “A need for change! A coding framework for improving transparency in decision modeling”.</p>
<p>You can also check out this <a href="https://darth-git.github.io/darthpack/">website</a> for details about the framework.</p>
