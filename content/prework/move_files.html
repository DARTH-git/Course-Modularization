<p><strong>Please ensure that you have completed all previous stages</strong> and do not hesitate to contact <code>alexandra.moskalewicz@sickkids.ca</code> or message us on Slack if you run into any problems at any stage.</p>
<p>If you have successfully completed all previous steps, now is the time to upload all files (<code>R</code> scripts, datasets, data dictionary, supporting documents etc.) that you will use at the workshop to your workshop GitHub repository.</p>
<p>To do so, simply copy and paste your workshop files to your local repo folder and push to your remote repo using GitHub Desktop. Details on how to do this are included in <a href="/prework/github">this section</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If you have patient level data that you want to use for your decision model, please do not upload on Github. Instead, please reach out to <a href="mailto:alexandra.moskalewicz@sickkids.ca" class="email">alexandra.moskalewicz@sickkids.ca</a> for further instructions.</strong></p>
