We will use Slack as the main platform for online communications. Throughout and after the workshop, we encourage the instructors and the participants to stay connected on Slack to exchange ideas, discuss problems and seek help from each other.

We will use Slack to mainly:

- Communicate with participants before, during and after live sessions
- Offer help with course logistics
- Answer questions about course materials
