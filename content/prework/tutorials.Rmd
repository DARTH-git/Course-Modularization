# Decision modeling tutorials:

We have published a number of modeling tutorials and methodology papers. A list of them can be found [here](http://darthworkgroup.com/publications/).

# DARTH GitHub

This is our group's [GitHub page](https://github.com/orgs/DARTH-git/dashboard) where we host different repositories for different projects, tutorials and packages like `dampack`, `darthpack`, and `darthtools`. 

# R tutorials:

[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)

This is the official site of R Markdown that has an abundance of resources and references about using R Markdown. 

[Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)

We strongly encourage you to adopt this coding style developed by RStudio since it makes your `R` code very clean and easy to read.
