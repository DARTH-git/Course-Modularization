<p>Prior to the workshop, please read the following tutorials created by <a href="http://darthworkgroup.com/">the DARTH workgroup</a>. This is so that you can get up to speed with basic to intermediate level of decision modeling in <code>R</code> and get familiar with our style of coding, setting up models in <code>R</code> and organizing our files.</p>
<p>They can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/DARTH-git/2024-DARTH-Advanced-Workshop">here</a>. They are in the the folder “Publications”.</p>

<h1>Decision modeling tutorials</h1>
<p>(Publications -&gt; DARTH publications)</p>
<p><strong>An Overview of R in Health Decision Sciences</strong></p>
<p>This paper provides a brief overview of using <code>R</code> for decision modeling. This is a good start for those who are not very familiar with working with decision models in <code>R</code>.</p>
<p><strong>A need for change! A coding framework for improving transparency in decision modeling</strong></p>
<p>This paper outlines a framework that we have developed for building a decision model in <code>R</code> from start to finish. We strongly encourage you to adhere to this framework when building/expanding your decision model.</p>
<p><strong>An Introductory Tutorial on Cohort State-Transition Models in R Using a Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Example</strong></p>
<p>This introductory paper goes over some theory about cohort state-transition models (Markov models) and goes into detail on the implementation of such models in <code>R</code>. For those who wish to build or work on a Markov model at the workshop, this is a must-read.</p>
<p><strong>A Tutorial on Time-Dependent Cohort State-Transition Models in R Using a Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Example</strong></p>
<p>This paper covers time-dependent cohort state-transition models (Markov models) and goes into detail on the implementation of such models in <code>R</code>. For those who wish to build or work on a time-dependent Markov model at the workshop, this is a must-read.</p>
<p><strong>A Multidimensional Array Representation of State-Transition Model Dynamics</strong></p>
<p>For those interested in working with state-transition rewards in their models, we encourage you to read this tutorial.</p>
<p><strong>Microsimulation Modeling for Health Decision Sciences Using R A Tutorial</strong></p>
<p>This paper goes over some theory about microsimulation modeling and goes into detail on the implementation of such models in <code>R</code>. For those who wish to build or work on a microsimulation model at the workshop, this is a must-read.</p>
<p><em>For those interested in discrete event simulations, we provided additional resources below.</em></p>

<h1>Discrete Event Simulations (DES)</h1>
<p>(Publications -&gt; Additional resources)</p>
<p>For those who will work on DES at the workshop (or are interested in general) we recommend the following two papers:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Comparing Strategies for Modeling Competing Risks in Discrete-Event Simulations</p></li>
<li><p>A New Method for Model-Based Health Economic Evaluation Utilizing and Extending Moment-Generating Functions</p></li>
