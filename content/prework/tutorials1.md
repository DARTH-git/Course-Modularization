Prior to the workshop, please read the following tutorials created by [the DARTH workgroup](http://darthworkgroup.com/). This is so that you can get up to speed with basic to intermediate level of decision modeling in `R` and get familiar with our style of coding, setting up models in `R` and organizing our files. 

They can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/DARTH-git/2024-DARTH-Advanced-Workshop). They are in the the folder "Publications".

# Decision modeling tutorials

(Publications -> DARTH publications)

**An Overview of R in Health Decision Sciences**

This paper provides a brief overview of using `R` for decision modeling. This is a good start for those who are not very familiar with working with decision models in `R`. 

**A need for change! A coding framework for improving transparency in decision modeling**

This paper outlines a framework that we have developed for building a decision model in `R` from start to finish. We strongly encourage you to adhere to this framework when building/expanding your decision model. 

**An Introductory Tutorial on Cohort State-Transition Models in R Using a Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Example**

This introductory paper goes over some theory about cohort state-transition models (Markov models) and goes into detail on the implementation of such models in `R`. For those who wish to build or work on a Markov model at the workshop, this is a must-read. 

**A Multidimensional Array Representation of State-Transition Model Dynamics**

For those interested in working with state-transition rewards in their models, we encourage you to read this tutorial.

**Microsimulation Modeling for Health Decision Sciences Using R A Tutorial**

This paper goes over some theory about microsimulation modeling and goes into detail on the implementation of such models in `R`. For those who wish to build or work on a microsimulation model at the workshop, this is a must-read. 

*For those interested in discrete event simulations, we provided additional resources below.*

# Discrete Event Simulations (DES)

(Publications -> Additional resources)

For those who will work on DES at the workshop (or are interested in general) we recommend the following two papers:

1. Comparing Strategies for Modeling Competing Risks in Discrete-Event Simulations

2. A New Method for Model-Based Health Economic Evaluation Utilizing and Extending Moment-Generating Functions
