      <description>This is the website for a five-day hands-on workshop on decision modeling in R.
The Decision Analysis in R for Technologies in Health (DARTH) workgroup is offering a workshop on An Overview of Decision Modeling Using R from July 20 to 24, 2020 (every day from 8:00AM to 11:00AM Eastern Time). The workshop will be offered virtually via Zoom. Co-instructors Fernando Alarid-Escudero, Hawre Jalal, Eline Krijkamp, Alan Yang and Petros Pechlivanoglou will cover the principles of cost-effectiveness analysis and decision analytic modeling and will guide participants in implementing decision trees, Markov models, and microsimulation models and their implementations in R.</description>

      <description>Although this is an introductory course, participants will be expected to have some experience with decision modeling and/or basic concepts of economic evaluation. We will cover the following topics at the workshop:
July 20: Introduction and building decision trees
July 21: Markov models
July 22: Microsimulation models
July 23: Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis
July 24: Calibration/ survival analysis and value of information analysis</description>
