# 04 Create and run decision tree model

# 04.1 Use OpenTree to create and run decision tree model

Create or open decision tree. 

The function `create_tree()` creates a blank tree and the function `open_tree()` opens an existing decision tree. 

*IMPORTANT*: since `create_tree()` always creates blank new tree, do not use it to access or modify an existing tree, or else the tree will get erased. Always use `open_tree()` to open and modify existing trees.

Any changes made to the tree in OpenTree are automatically saved as a `.json` file to the working directory. If you are running it in an R script, the `.json` file will be saved to the path on your machine specified in `dir_name`. If you are running it in an R markdown document, the `.json` file will be saved to the path where the R markdown document is located. 

```{r}
#create_tree(file_name = "Helloworld", dir_name = getwd())
open_tree(file_name = "HVEsolution2", dir_name = getwd())
```

Extract probability weights and outcomes of the decision tree.

```{r, warning = F}
# extract the probability weights and outcomes  
df_tree <- evaluate_model("HVEsolution2", n_payoffs = 2)
```

Compute total cost and QALYs.

```{r}
# vector of total cost and QALYs
v_total_qaly <- v_total_cost <- vector(mode = "numeric", length = n_str)

# Calculate total costs and QALYs for each strategy 
 for (i in 1:n_str) {
  v_total_qaly[i] <- df_tree[[i]]$prob %*% df_tree[[i]]$payoff1
  v_total_cost[i] <- df_tree[[i]]$prob %*% df_tree[[i]]$payoff2
 }

# calculate vector of nmb
v_nmb <- v_total_qaly * wtp - v_total_cost 
          
df_output <- data.frame(Strategy =  v_names_str,
                        Cost     =  v_total_cost,
                        Effect   =  v_total_qaly,
                        NMB      =  v_nmb)

# model output
