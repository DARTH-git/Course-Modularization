# 00 Case example
Viral encephalitis can be caused by herpes viruses (HVE) or other viruses (OVE). Herpes viruses cause approximately 52% of cases of viral encephalitis. Without treatment, the risk of complications (death or severe sequelae) for HVE is 71%; for OVE, the risk is only 1%. A drug, vidarabine, decreases the likelihood of complications due to HVE from 71% down to 36%. However, among OVE patients, treatment with vidarabine is associated with severe side effects, increasing the risk of complications from the 1% baseline to 20%. It is possible to obtain a definitive diagnosis of HVE by means of a brain biopsy, but the procedure itself also has a 5% probability of inducing complications.

You are tasked with evaluating the healthcare costs and benefits associated with three possible management strategies (no treatment, vidarabine treatment, or brain biopsy followed by vidarabine treatment for those who are diagnosed with HVE). Benefits will be measured in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). 

The healthcare cost of a case of viral encephalitis without complications is \$1,200; however, if complications occur, the cost rises to \$9,000. The cost of vidarabine treatment is \$9,500, while a brain biopsy is a \$25,000 procedure. 

A patient who recovers from viral encephalitis without complications has an average of 20 remaining QALYs; however, a patient who experiences complications has an average of 19 remaining QALYs. Since a brain biopsy is an unpleasant procedure, patients who undergo it also experience a one-time loss of 0.01 QALYs regardless of the outcome of the biopsy.

Parameters are summarized in Table 1 and the tree structure is shown in the figure below.

##04.1.1 Extra code to demonstrate the use of "clones"
The structure of a decision tree consist of replication parts. 
To avoid coding the same equation multiple times, we can make use of a function that calculated that section.
This is comparable, with what is in specialized software called a clone. 
In de code chunk below, we show how we first develop the clone function. And next how to use the function. Finally, we demonstrate that we get identical results compared to what we had before. 
```{r}
# Develop a function to calculate the vector of weights for the decision tree
calculate_hve_complication <- function(p_HVE, p_HVE_comp, p_OVE_comp){
    # p_HVE: the probability of having p_HVE
    # p_HVE_comp: the probability of getting a complication when you have an HVE infection
    # p_OVE_comp: the probability of getting a complication when you have an OVE infection
       v_weights <-  c(    p_HVE  *      p_HVE_comp     ,  # HVE, complications
                            p_HVE  * (1 - p_HVE_comp)    ,  # HVE, no complications
                       (1 - p_HVE) *      p_OVE_comp     ,  # OVE, complications
                       (1 - p_HVE) * (1 - p_OVE_comp))
        return (v_weights) # return the vector of weights
         }

# Create vector of weights for each strategy using the function 
v_w_no_tx_clone  <- calculate_hve_complication(p_HVE = p_HVE, p_HVE_comp = p_HVE_comp, p_OVE_comp = p_OVE_comp)
  
v_w_tx_clone     <- calculate_hve_complication(p_HVE = p_HVE, p_HVE_comp = p_HVE_comp_tx, p_OVE_comp = p_OVE_comp_tx)

v_w_biopsy_clone <- c(p_biopsy_death,  
                    (1 - p_biopsy_death) *  calculate_hve_complication(p_HVE = p_HVE, p_HVE_comp = p_HVE_comp_tx, p_OVE_comp = p_OVE_comp))
                      
# Check if the clone gives identical results   
all.equal(v_w_no_tx_clone, v_w_no_tx)
all.equal(v_w_tx_clone, v_w_tx)
all.equal(v_w_biopsy_clone, v_w_biopsy)
