```

# 04 Define and initialize matrices and vectors

## 04.1 Cohort trace

```{r}
# create the cohort trace
m_M_notrt <- m_M_trt <-  matrix(NA, 
                          nrow = n_t + 1 ,  # create Markov trace (n_t + 1 because R doesn't 
                                            # understand Cycle 0)

                          dimnames = list(0:n_t, v_n))

m_M_notrt[1, ] <- m_M_trt[1, ] <- v_init          # initialize first cycle of Markov trace
```

## 04.2 Transition probability matrix

```{r}
# create the transition probability matrices
m_P_notrt  <- m_P_trt <- matrix(0,
                    nrow = n_states, ncol = n_states,
                    dimnames = list(v_n, v_n))  # name the columns and rows of the transition 
                                               
# print the probability matrices 
m_P_notrt      # for standard of care
m_P_trt  # treatment
```

Fill in the transition probability matrix:

```{r}
# For Standard of Care 
# from Healthy
m_P_notrt["Healthy", "Healthy"] <- (1 - p_HD) * (1 - p_HS)
m_P_notrt["Healthy", "Sick"]    <- (1 - p_HD) * p_HS
m_P_notrt["Healthy", "Dead"]    <- p_HD

# from Sick
m_P_notrt["Sick", "Sick"] <- 1 - p_SD
m_P_notrt["Sick", "Dead"] <- p_SD

# from Dead
m_P_notrt["Dead", "Dead"] <- 1

# Under treatment
m_P_trt <- m_P_notrt  # Assign the matrix for standard of care to the transition probability matrix for treatment
# replace values that are different under treatment 
m_P_trt["Healthy", "Healthy"] <- (1 - p_HD) * (1 - p_HS_trt)
m_P_trt["Healthy", "Sick"]    <- (1 - p_HD) * p_HS_trt
```

## 04.3 Check if transition probability structure and probabilities are valid

```

# 05 Run Markov model

```{r}
for (t in 1:n_t){                               # loop through the number of cycles
  m_M_notrt[t + 1, ] <- m_M_notrt[t, ]     %*% m_P_notrt      # estimate the state vector for the next cycle (t + 1)
  m_M_trt[t + 1, ]   <- m_M_trt[t, ] %*% m_P_trt  # for treatment
}
```
