This code implements a simulation-time-dependent Sick-Sicker cSTM model to  conduct a CEA of two strategies:
- Standard of Care (SoC): best available care for the patients with the disease. This scenario reflects the natural history of the disease progression.
- Strategy AB: This strategy combines treatment A and treatment B. The strategy treats both those Sick and Sicker. However, only for those Sick the treatment has an effect. For Sick individuals the disease progression is reduced, and individuals in the Sick state have an improved quality of life.

# Exercise: Construct a Markov Model of the Sick-Sicker Disease

In this exercise, we will model a hypothetical disease that affects individuals with an average age of 25 years and results in increased mortality, increased healthcare costs, and reduced quality of life. The disease has two levels; affected individuals initially become sick but can subsequently progress and become sicker. Two alternative strategies exist for this hypothetical disease: Standard of Care (SoC) and a treatment strategy - Strategy AB. Under the treatment strategy, individuals in the sick and sicker states are treated until they recover (only if sick; individuals in the sicker state cannot recover) or die. The cost of the treatment is additive to the baseline healthcare costs of being sick or sicker. The treatment improves quality of life for those individuals who are sick but has no impact on the quality of life of those who are sicker. Unfortunately, it is not possible to reliably differentiate between people in the sick and sicker states, so treatment cannot be targeted to only those in the sick state. You are asked to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the treatment.

To model this disease, we will rely on a state-transition cohort model, called the Sick-Sicker model, first described by Enns et al. The Sick-Sicker model consists of four health states: Healthy (H), two disease states, Sick (S1) and Sicker (S2), and Dead (D) (Figure 1). All individuals start in the Healthy state. Over time, healthy individuals may develop the disease and can progress to S1. Individuals in S1 can recover (return to state H), progress further to S2 or die. Individuals in S2 cannot recover (i.e. cannot transition to either S1 or H). Individuals in H have a baseline probability of death; individuals in S1 and S2 experience increased mortality compared to those in the H state, given in terms of hazard ratios. These ratios are used to calculate the probabilities of dying when in S1 and S2.

*Note: To calculate the probability of dying from S1 and S2, use the hazard ratios provided. To do so, first multiply the rate of dying from healthy by the appropriate hazard ratio; finally, convert this rate back to a probability. Recall that you can convert between rates and probabilities using the following formulas: $r = -log(1-p)$ and $p = 1-e^{(-rt)}$. The package `darthtools` also has the functions `prob_to_rate` and `rate_to_prob` that might be of use to you.

* 1. *HMD* : This is the Human mortality database. We provide you a files called `HMD_USA_Mx_2015.csv` with the age specific mortality rates. The data has the columns X, Year, Age, Female, Male, Total and OpenInterval. We will use the overall age specific mortality rate from the Total column.

### Exercise - set-up

There are quite some steps you need to take in order to create a Markov model reflecting this case. Start by making sure that you have all the course material structured in the suggested way. There should be an R projects in the folder, a file ending on `.Rproj`, double click on this file to open the Rstudio environment. Working from a Rproject avoid struggles with working directories. 

While in you Markov Sick-Sicker R project, open this `markov_sick-sicker_time_exercise_template.Rmd`. This is a template that guides you step by step through the exercise. In addition it helps you to load the packages and the necessary data. The next chunk load the packages.
