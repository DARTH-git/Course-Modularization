To program this tutorial we used:
R version 4.0.5 (2021-03-31)
Platform: 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor
Running under: Mac OS 12.2.1
RStudio: Version 1.4.1717 2009-2021 RStudio, Inc

This code implements a state-residence time-dependent Sick-Sicker cSTM model to conduct a CEA of two strategies:
- Standard of Care (SoC): best available care for the patients with the  disease. This scenario reflects the natural history of the disease 
  progression.
- Strategy AB: This strategy combines treatment A and treatment B. The disease progression is reduced, and individuals in the Sick state have an 
  improved quality of life.

# Exercise I: Variations on the Sick-Sicker Markov Model

Previously, you built a Markov of the Sick-Sicker model. In this exercise, you will expand on that model to incorporate dependence on time since model start (simulation-time dependency) and on state-residence time dependency.

**Time since model start**
  
Healthy individuals are no longer assumed to have a fixed mortality rate. Their mortality rate depends on their age. The Human Mortality Database (HMD) (www.mortality.org) provides these age specific mortality rates (Mx1x1). You can load this data in R using different packages, for example the HMDHFplus, demography or data.table package. Registration (free) on the HMD website is required in order to use the data. For this exercise, we provide you with this mortality rate for the US in the file “HMD_USA_Mx_2015.csv”.

Remember: individuals in S1 and S2 still have an increased mortality relative to healthy individuals, as described in the original exercise. The same hazard ratios are used to calculate the probabilities of dying from S1 and S2 in this exercise. 

**State residence**
  
It has been recently discovered that the risk of progression from Sick to Sicker increases the longer a person has been sick. This increase follows a Weibull growth curve, calculated as 

$p_{S1S2(t)} = \lambda_\gamma t^{(\gamma-1)}$
  
where $t$ is the $t$-th cycle (year) that a person has been in the Sick state. $\lambda = 0.08$ and $\gamma = 1.1$ are the scale and shape parameters of the Weibull function, respectively.

We will now expand the model to include age and state residence dependency by adding age varying probabilities for death and tunnel states for S1, as shown in Figure 2.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.cap='Schematic representation of the Sick-Sicker model', fig.align = 'center'}
if (!require(here)) install.packages('here')
if (!require(knitr)) install.packages('knitr')
include_graphics(here::here("figures", "sick_sicker_diagram.png"))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.cap = 'Schematic representation of the Sick-Sicker model with tunnels states for S1', fig.align = 'center'}
if (!require(here)) install.packages('knitr')
if (!require(knitr)) install.packages('knitr')
include_graphics(here::here("figures", "sick_sicker_tunnels_diagram.png"))
```

## Tasks

Using the template `markov_sick-sicker_tunnels_template.Rmd`, please do the following. 

1. Incorporate the tunnel states in the Markov trace and initialize it with everyone being healthy at model start. 

2. Create a 3D transition probability array to account for tunnels and age dependency.

3. Fill in the 3D transition probability array accounting for the tunnel states for S1 and the age dependence of transitioning to death

4. Costs and utilities for all tunnel states are the same. Therefore, aggregate the Markov trace back to a healthy sick-sicker-dead trace and estimate total costs and QALYs for both strategies.

5.	Estimate the cost-effectiveness of Strategy AB vs SoC.

6.	Create a cost-effectiveness table with all results of interest.

*Note: To calculate the probability of dying from S1 and S2, use the hazard ratios provided. To do so, first multiply the rate of dying from healthy by the appropriate hazard ratio; finally, convert this rate back to a probability. Recall that you can convert between rates and probabilities using the following formulas: $r = -log(1-p)$ and $p = 1-e^{(-rt)}$. The package `darthtools` also has the functions `prob_to_rate` and `rate_to_prob` that might be of use to you.

* 1. *HMD* : This is the Human mortality database. We provide you a files called `HMD_USA_Mx_2015.csv` with the age specific mortality rates. The data has the columns X, Year, Age, Female, Male, Total and OpenInterval. We will use the overall age specific mortality rate from the Total column.

## Age specific all cause mortality

The code below shows you how to get the data into your R environment. We also provide this in the template. You can use function `rate_to_prob` to convert `v_r_HD` into `v_p_HD`.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
lt_usa_2015 <- read.csv("../data/HMD_USA_Mx_2015.csv")
head(lt_usa_2015)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Transition probabilities (per cycle) and hazard ratios
# Read age-specific mortality rates from csv file
# if you have the data in the same folder as you markdown
#lt_usa_2015 <- read.csv("HMD_USA_Mx_2015.csv")

# if you have a data folder
lt_usa_2015 <- read.csv("../data/HMD_USA_Mx_2015.csv")

# select the age-specific mortality rates from csv file for the age 25 - 54
v_r_HD <- lt_usa_2015 %>% 
  filter(Age >= age & Age <= (max_age - 1)) %>%
  select(Total) %>%
  as.matrix()
```
