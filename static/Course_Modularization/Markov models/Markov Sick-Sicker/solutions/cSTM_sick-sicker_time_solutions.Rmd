```{r}
# All starting healthy
v_m_init <- c(H = 1, S1 = 0, S2 = 0, D = 0) # initial state vector

```

## 04.2 Initialize cohort traces

# Store the initial state vector in the first row of the cohort trace
m_M_SoC[1, ] <- v_m_init

### Initialize cohort trace for strategy AB 
# Structure and initial states are the same as for SoC
m_M_strAB <- m_M_SoC # Strategy AB
```

## 04.3 Create transition probability matrices

```{r}

a_P_SoC["S2", "D", ]  <-     v_p_S2D_age
## From D
a_P_SoC["D", "D", ]   <- 1

### Initialize transition probability array for strategy AB 
a_P_strAB <- a_P_SoC
# Update only transition probabilities from S1 involving p_S1S2
a_P_strAB["S1", "S1", ] <- (1 - v_p_S1D_age) * (1 - (p_S1H + p_S1S2_trtAB))

### Check that transition probabilities are [0, 1] 
check_transition_probability(a_P_SoC,   verbose = TRUE)
check_transition_probability(a_P_strAB, verbose = TRUE)
### Check that all rows for each slice of the array sum to 1
