To program this tutorial we used:
R version 4.0.5 (2021-03-31)
Platform: 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor
Running under: Mac OS 12.2.1
RStudio: Version 1.4.1717 2009-2021 RStudio, Inc

This code implements a state-residence time-dependent Sick-Sicker cSTM model to conduct a CEA of two strategies:
- Standard of Care (SoC): best available care for the patients with the  disease. This scenario reflects the natural history of the disease 
  progression.
- Strategy AB: This strategy combines treatment A and treatment B. The disease progression is reduced, and individuals in the Sick state have an 
  improved quality of life.
