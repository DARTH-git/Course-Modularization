# 04 Define and initialize matrices and vectors

## 04.1 Cohort trace

```{r}
# create the markov trace matrix M capturing the proportion of the cohort in each state 
# at each cycle
m_M_notrt <- m_M_trt <- matrix(NA, 
                               nrow     = n_t + 1, ncol = n_states,
                               dimnames = list(paste("cycle", 0:n_t, sep = " "), v_names_states))

head(m_M_notrt) # show first 6 rows of the matrix 

# The cohort starts as healthy
m_M_notrt[1, ] <- m_M_trt[1, ] <- v_init  # initiate first cycle of cohort trace 
```

## 04.2 Transition probability array

```{r}
# create the transition probability array for NO treatment
a_P_notrt <- array(0,  # Create 3-D array
                   dim = c(n_states, n_states, n_t),
                   dimnames = list(v_names_states, v_names_states, 0:(n_t-1))) # name dimensions
a_P_notrt[, , 1:3]
```

Fill in the transition probability array:

```{r}
# from Healthy

# from Sick

# from Sicker

# from Dead

# create transition probability array for treatment same as no treatment
a_P_trt <- a_P_notrt  

# In the Sick-Sicker example the transitions are similar. Therefore, you can use the same values in the transition probability array. If you are modeling other strategies you have to update the transition probabilities accordingly
