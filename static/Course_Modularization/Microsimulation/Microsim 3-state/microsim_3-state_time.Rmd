cycle_length    <- 1                             # cycle length equal to one year (use 1/12 for monthly)
n_cycles        <- 60                            # number of cycles

n_i             <- 10000                         # number of individuals

### Discounting factors 
d_c <- 0.03 # annual discount rate for costs 
d_e <- 0.03 # annual discount rate for QALYs

### Strategies 
v_names_str     <- c("Standard of Care",         # store the strategy names
                     "Treatment A", 
                     "Treatment B")  
n_str           <- length(v_names_str)           # number of strategies

### Transition probabilities
# (all non-dead probabilities are conditional on survival)
p_HS_SoC    <- 0.05  # probability of becoming sick when healthy, conditional on surviving, under standard of care
p_HS_trtA   <- 0.04  # probability of becoming sick when healthy, conditional on surviving, under treatment A

## 03.2 Calculate internal model parameters

```{r}
### Cycle-specific discount weight for costs and effects 
v_dwc     <- 1 / ((1 + (d_e * cycle_length)) ^ (0:n_cycles))
v_dwe     <- 1 / ((1 + (d_c * cycle_length)) ^ (0:n_cycles))

```

# 04 Sample individual level characteristics

## 04.1 Static characteristics

```{r}
# randomly sample the sex of an individual (50% female)
v_sex <- sample(x = c("Female", "Male"), prob = c(0.5, 0.5), size = n_i, replace = TRUE) 
```

## 04.2 Dynamic characteristics 

```{r}
# Specify the initial health state of the individuals 
# everyone begins in the healthy state (in this example)
v_M_init  <- rep("Healthy", times = n_i)   
v_Ts_init <- rep(0, n_i)  # a vector with the time of being sick at the start of the model 
```

## 04.3 Create a dataframe with the individual characteristics 

```{r}
# create a data frame with each individual's 
# ID number, treatment effect modifier, age and initial time in sick state 
df_X  <- data.frame(ID = 1:n_i, Sex = v_sex, n_cycles_s = v_Ts_init, M_init = v_M_init)
# NOTE: we use n_cycles_s for the number of times being sick, we start the data frame with the initial "history" of time being sick by saving v_Ts_init. However, during the simulation this value is updated and therefore called numer of times being sick.
head(df_X) # print the first rows of the dataframe
```

# 05 Define Simulation Functions

## 05.1 Probability function

The `Probs` function updates the transition probabilities of every cycle is shown below.

```{r}
Probs <- function(M_t, df_X, Trt = "SoC") { 
  # Arguments:
    # M_t:  health state occupied at cycle t (character variable)
    # df_X: data frame with individual characteristics data 
    # Trt:  treatment
  # Returns: 
    # transition probabilities for that cycle
  
  # Treatment specific transition probabilities
  if (Trt == "SoC") {
    p_HS <- p_HS_SoC
  } else if (Trt == "A") {
    p_HS <- p_HS_trtA 
  } else if (Trt == "B") {
    p_HS <- p_HS_trtB
  }
  
  # create matrix of state transition probabilities
  m_p_t           <- matrix(0, nrow = n_states, ncol = n_i)  
  # give the state names to the rows
  rownames(m_p_t) <-  v_names_states                               
  
  # lookup baseline probability and rate of dying based on individual characteristics
  p_HD_all <- inner_join(df_X, df_p_HD, by = c("Sex"))
  p_HD     <- p_HD_all[M_t == "Healthy", "p_HD"]
  
  # update m_p_t with the appropriate probabilities 
  # (all non-death probabilities are conditional on survival)
  # transition probabilities when Healthy 
  m_p_t["Healthy", M_t == "Healthy"] <- (1 - p_HD) * (1 - p_HS)
  m_p_t["Sick",    M_t == "Healthy"] <- (1 - p_HD) *      p_HS 
  m_p_t["Dead",    M_t == "Healthy"] <-      p_HD              
  
  # transition probabilities when Sick 
  m_p_t["Healthy", M_t == "Sick"]    <-  0
  m_p_t["Sick",    M_t == "Sick"]    <-  1 - p_SD[df_X$n_cycles_s]
  m_p_t["Dead",    M_t == "Sick"]    <-      p_SD[df_X$n_cycles_s]     
 
  # transition probabilities when Dead
  m_p_t["Healthy", M_t == "Dead"]    <- 0
  m_p_t["Sick",    M_t == "Dead"]    <- 0
  m_p_t["Dead",    M_t == "Dead"]    <- 1  
  
  return(t(m_p_t))
}       
```

## 05.2 Cost function

The `Costs` function estimates the costs at every cycle.

```{r}
Costs <- function (M_t, Trt = "SoC") {
  # Arguments:
    # M_t: health state occupied at cycle t (character variable)
  # Returns: 
    # costs accrued in this cycle
    # Trt:  treatment
  
  # Treatment specific transition costs
  if (Trt == "SoC") {
    c_trt <- 0
  } else if (Trt == "A") {
    c_trt <- c_trtA
  } else if (Trt == "B") {
    c_trt <- c_trtB
  }
  
  c_t <- c()
  c_t[M_t == "Healthy"] <- c_H + c_trt  # costs accrued by being healthy this cycle
  c_t[M_t == "Sick"]    <- c_S          # costs accrued by being sick this cycle
  c_t[M_t == "Dead"]    <- c_D          # costs at dead state
  
  return(c_t)  # return costs accrued this cycle
}
```

## 05.3 Health outcome function

The `Effs` function to update the utilities at every cycle.

```{r}
Effs <- function (M_t, cl = 1) {
  # Arguments:
    # M_t: health state occupied at cycle t (character variable)
     # cl:   cycle length (default is 1)
  # Returns: 
    # QALYs accrued this cycle 
  
  q_t <- c() 
  q_t[M_t == "Healthy"] <- u_H  # utility for being healthy this cycle
  q_t[M_t == "Sick"]    <- u_S  # utility for being sick this cycle
  q_t[M_t == "Dead"]    <- u_D  # utility for dead state
  
  QALYs <- q_t * cl  # calculate the QALYs during cycle t
  return(QALYs)      # return the QALYs accrued this cycle
}
```

## 05.4 Microsimulation function

Below we develop the microsimulation function that allows the model to be run.

```{r}
MicroSim <- function(n_i, df_X, seed = 1, Trt = "SoC") {
  # Arguments:  
    # n_i: number of individuals
    # df_X: data frame with individual data 
    # seed: seed for the random number generator, default is 1
    # Trt: treatment 
  # Returns:
    # results: data frame with total cost and QALYs
  
  set.seed(seed) # set a seed to be able to reproduce the same results
  
  # create three matrices called m_M, m_C and m_E
  # number of rows is equal to the n_i, the number of columns is equal to n_cycles 
  # (the initial state and all the n_cycles cycles)
  # m_M is used to store the health state information over time for every individual
  # m_C is used to store the costs information over time for every individual
  # m_E is used to store the effects information over time for every individual
  
  m_M <- m_C <- m_E <-  matrix(nrow = n_i, ncol = n_cycles + 1, 
                               dimnames = list(paste("ind"  , 1:n_i, sep = " "), 
                                               paste("cycle", 0:n_cycles, sep = " ")))  
 
  m_M[, 1] <- as.character(df_X$M_init) # initial health state
  m_C[, 1] <- Costs(m_M[, 1])  # costs accrued during cycle 0
  m_E[, 1] <- Effs(m_M[, 1], cl = 1)   # QALYs accrued during cycle 0
  
  # open a loop for time running cycles 1 to n_cycles 
  for (t in 1:n_cycles) {
    # calculate the transition probabilities for the cycle based on health state t
    m_P <- Probs(m_M[, t], df_X, Trt = Trt)
    # check if transition probabilities are between 0 and 1
    check_transition_probability(m_P, verbose = TRUE)
    # check if each of the rows of the transition probabilities matrix sum to one
    check_sum_of_transition_array(m_P, n_rows = n_i, n_cycles = n_cycles, verbose = TRUE)
    
    # sample the next health state and store that state in matrix m_M
    m_M[, t + 1]  <- samplev(m_P, 1)    
    # calculate costs per individual during cycle t + 1
    m_C[, t + 1]  <- Costs(m_M[, t + 1], Trt = Trt)  
    # calculate QALYs per individual during cycle t + 1
    m_E[, t + 1]  <- Effs (m_M[, t + 1], cl = 1)  
    
    # update time since illness onset for t + 1 
    # NOTE: this code has a "reset of history" for time being sick
    # once someone is not "Sick" anymore, we reset n_cycles_s (set back to zero)
    # when you don't want a "reset" replace the last zero with teh current value
    df_X$n_cycles_s <- if_else(m_M[, t + 1] == "Sick", df_X$n_cycles_s + 1, 0) 
    
    # Display simulation progress
    if(t/(n_cycles/10) == round(t/(n_cycles/10), 0)) { # display progress every 10%
      cat('\r', paste(t/n_cycles * 100, "% done", sep = " "))
    }
    
  } # close the loop for the time points 
  
  # calculate  
  tc      <- m_C %*% v_dwc  # total (discounted) cost per individual
  te      <- m_E %*% v_dwe  # total (discounted) QALYs per individual 
  tc_hat  <- mean(tc)       # average (discounted) cost 
  te_hat  <- mean(te)       # average (discounted) QALY  
  # store the results from the simulation in a list
  results <- list(m_M = m_M, m_C = m_C, m_E = m_E, tc = tc , te = te, 
                  tc_hat = tc_hat, te_hat = te_hat)   
  
  return(results)  # return the results

} # end of the `MicroSim` function  
```
