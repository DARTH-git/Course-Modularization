```{r}
ceac_obj <- ceac(wtp = v_wtp, psa = l_psa)
# Regions of highest probability of cost-effectiveness for each strategy
summary(ceac_obj)
# CEAC & CEAF plot
plot(ceac_obj)
```

## 08.4.6 Expected Loss Curves (ELCs)

The expected loss is the the quantification of the foregone benefits when choosing a suboptimal strategy given current evidence.

```{r}
elc_obj <- calc_exp_loss(wtp = v_wtp, psa = l_psa)
elc_obj
# ELC plot
plot(elc_obj, log_y = FALSE)
```

## 08.4.7 Expected value of perfect information (EVPI)

```{r}
evpi <- calc_evpi(wtp = v_wtp, psa = l_psa)
# EVPI plot
plot(evpi, effect_units = "QALY")
```

# 09 Using `R` package `hesim`

```{r}
p_load("hesim")
```

## 09.1 Model setup

Here we define target population and intervention strategies.

We have one representative patient here of age 25, we can think of this as a cohort of homogenous patients instead of one individual patient.

```{r}
# define strategies
strategies <- data.frame(
  strategy_id   = 1:n_str,
  strategy_name = v_names_str
  )
# define patient cohort
patients <- data.frame(
  patient_id = 1,
  age        = 25
)
# create dataset with 
hesim_dat <- hesim_data(
  strategies = strategies,
  patients   = patients
)
hesim_dat
```

## 09.2 parameters

```{r}
params <- list(
  # medical costs
  c_medical    = c(Healthy = c_H, Sick = c_S),
  c_medical_se = c(Healthy = 100, Sick = 100),
  # treatment costs (embedded in medical costs since only those who are sick get treated)
  c_trt  = c_trt,
  # state utilities
  u_mean = c(Healthy = u_H,  Sick = u_S),
  u_se   = c(Healthy = 0.05, Sick = 0.05)
)
```

## 09.3 PSA setup

`rng_def()`

```{r}
rng_def <- define_rng({
  list( # Parameters to return
    # medical costs
    c_medical = gamma_rng(mean = c_medical, sd = c_medical_se),
    c_trt     = gamma_rng(mean = c_trt,     sd = 1000),
    # state utilities
    u = beta_rng(mean = u_mean, sd = u_se)
  )
}, n = 1000)
```

## 09.4 Transform parameters

```{r}
input_data <- hesim::expand(hesim_dat, by = c("strategies", "patients"))
head(input_data)
```

The function `define_tparams()` returns:

- `tpmatrix`: The transition probability matrix

- `utility`: Utility assigned to each health state

- `costs`: Costs assigned to each health state or each cost category

Your task: write mathematical expressions

The function: automatically loops over PSA iterations (running the model on each sampled parameter set)

```{r}
tparams_def <- define_tparams({
  # treatment reduces the risk of getting sick
  rr <- ifelse(strategy_name == "Standard of Care", 1, p_HS_trt / p_HS) # relative risk
  
  list(
    tpmatrix = tpmatrix(
      (1 - p_HD) * (1 - p_HS * rr),  (1 - p_HD) * (p_HS * rr),  p_HD,  
       0,  C,  p_SD,
       0,  0,  1          
    ),
    
    utility = u,
    costs = list(
      treatment = ifelse(strategy_name == "Standard of Care", 0, c_trt),
      medical   = c_medical
    )
  )
})
```

## 09.5 Simulation

Construct model:

```{r}
mod_def <- define_model(tparams_def = tparams_def, 
                        rng_def     = rng_def, 
                        params      = params)
```

Initialize-model:

```{r}
cost_args <- list(
  treatment = list(method = "starting"),
  medical   = list(method = "wlos")
)
econmod <- create_CohortDtstm(mod_def, input_data, cost_args = cost_args)
```

Simulate outcomes:

```{r}
econmod$sim_stateprobs(n_cycles = n_t)
head(econmod$stateprobs_)
```

```{r}
econmod$sim_qalys(dr = d_e, lys = TRUE, integrate_method = "riemann_right")
head(econmod$qalys_)
```

```{r}
econmod$sim_costs(dr = d_c, integrate_method = "riemann_right")
head(econmod$costs_)
```

## 09.6 Cost-effectivess analysis

```{r}
ce_sim <- econmod$summarize()
cea_pw_out <- cea_pw(ce_sim, 
                     comparator = 1, 
                     dr_qalys = 0.03, dr_costs = 0.03,
                     k = seq(0, 5000, 1000))

## @knitr icer
icer_tbl(cea_pw_out, colnames = strategies$strategy_name) 
```

# 10 Overview of `hesim`

**Advantages**:

- Easy to build models without having to program the complete model structure (easier for novice modelers).

- A lot of the modeling code are implemented for you in the back end. 

- Suitable for modelers who are not familiar with `R` programming and functionality.

- Code written in `C++` in the back end, which offers enhanced computational speed.

**Disadvantages**:

- Its rigid function structure inhibits its ability tweak models or incorporate more complex model components (e.g. tunnel states, transition rewards).

- Does not provide the option for running deterministic analysis or one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses.

- Does not provide the ability to capture information about the specific transitions among health states (transition dynamics).

- Does not provide the ability to easily compute epidemiological outcomes.

- Does not allow costs to be applied to certain health states (at least not easily).
