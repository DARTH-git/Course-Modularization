```

# 04 Sample individual level characteristics

## 04.1 Static characteristics

```{r}
v_x <- runif(n_i, min = 0.95, max = 1.05) # treatment effect modifier at baseline 
# your turn

```

## 04.2 Dynamic characteristics 

```{r}
# your turn
     
```

## 04.3 Create a dataframe with the individual characteristics 

```{r}
# your turn
# HINT: df_X <- # data.frame(# ADD ALL CHARACTERISTICS) 

```

# 05 Define Simulation Functions

*HINT*: There is no need to make two functions for each strategy. We recommend to make one `Probs()`, one `Costs()` and one `Effs()` function and have a function argument `Trt` which you "switch" on and off (i.e TRUE/FALSE - or 0/1) of the strategy of interest. 

Please see a hypothetical example below :

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cost_stay <- function (days = 0, Trt = FALSE) {
  # Arguments:
    # days: days an individual is staying in a care facility
    # Trt:  is the individual treated? (default is FALSE)
  # Returns:
    # costs accrued in this cycle
  
  c_stay_day <- 100   # the price to stay a day at the care facility
  c_trt     < - 3000  # the price of treatment, total price for drug. Drug requires one dose
  
  cost <- c_stay_day * days + Trt * c_trt # calculate total cost

  return(cost)        # return the price
}

cost_stay_noTrt <- cost_stay(days = 10, Trt = FALSE)  # run the function for the no treatment strategy
cost_stay_Trt   <- cost_stay(days = 10, Trt = TRUE)   # run the function for the treatment strategy

cost_stay_noTrt
cost_stay_Trt
```

## 05.1 Probability function

The function that updates the transition probabilities of every cycle is shown below.

Please make sure you  incorporate the time dependency

```{r}
# your turn
# HINT: In this function you have to incorporate age specific mortality and incorporate 
# the change in probability of the years spend in the sick state

```

## 05.2 Cost function

The `Costs` function estimates the costs at every cycle.

```{r}
# your turn
# Make sure you incorporate the cost of the treatment in the treatment strategy for both sick and sicker

```

## 05.3 Health outcome function

The `Effs` function to update the utilities at every cycle.

```{r}
# your turn
# HINT: Make sure you incorporate the treatment effect modifier 
# HINT: Remember treatment improves the quality of life for those in the Sick (S1) state but not for those in the Sicker (S2) state
```

## 05.4 The Microsimulation function

You need to develop the main function `MicroSim()` that runs the microsimulation. 

```{r}
# your turn
# HINT: Build your own `MicroSim` function here that calls the Effs() and Costs() functions and samples the new state for the n_i individuals 

```

# 06 Run Microsimulation

You have to run the `Microsim()` function twice. Once for the treatment strategy and once of the no-treatment strategy, as follows:

- `outcomes_no_trt <- MicroSim(n_i, df_X, Trt = FALSE, seed = 1)`

- `outcomes_trt    <- MicroSim(n_i, df_X, Trt = TRUE,  seed = 1)`

# 07 Visualize results

```{r}
# your turn
# HINT: use functions in darthtools or check the example code

```

# 08 Cost Effectiveness Analysis

```{r}
# store the mean costs of each strategy in a new variable v_C (vector of costs)
# remove # below
# v_C <- c(outcomes_no_trt$tc_hat, outcomes_trt$tc_hat)

# store the mean QALYs of each strategy in a new variable v_E (vector of effects)
# remove # below
# v_E <- c(outcomes_no_trt$te_hat, outcomes_trt$te_hat)


# remove # below
# use dampack to calculate the ICER
# calculate_icers(cost       = v_C,
#                 effect     = v_E,
#                 strategies = v_names_str)
```

# 09 Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (PSA)
