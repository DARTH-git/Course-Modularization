# 04 Digitized Data

Use the function `digitise()` to translate the digitised OS and PFS data into patient level information.

```{r, results="hide"}
# Create IPD and KM data for the OS curves
digitise(surv_inp   = "OS_Examp.txt", 
         nrisk_inp  = "OS_Examp_AtRisk.txt", 
         km_output  = "KMdata_OS.txt", 
         ipd_output = "IPDdata_OS.txt")

# Create IPD and KM data for the PFS curves (there have been 99 events in the cohort)
digitise(surv_inp   = "PFS_Examp.txt", 
         nrisk_inp  = "PFS_Examp_AtRisk.txt", 
         km_output  = "KMdata_PFS.txt", 
         ipd_output = "IPDdata_PFS.txt")

# Link the IPD files across the two arms of the trial for OS and PFS
IPD_OS  <- make.ipd(ipd_files = c("IPDdata_OS.txt"), ctr = 1, 
                    var.labs  = c("time","event","arm"))
IPD_PFS <- make.ipd(ipd_files = c("IPDdata_PFS.txt"), ctr = 1,
                    var.labs  = c("time","event","arm"))

# 05 Analysis

## 05.1 Partitioned Survival model

```{r}
# fit all parametric models to the data and extract the AIC/BIC 
# Select the one with the most appropriate fit
# Repeat for PFS and OS

                    extrapolate = T)

                    extrapolate = T)

# plot the results of PSM and the true data 
plot_trace_PSM(time = times, partsurv.model = m_M_PSM)
```

Calculate total cost and QALYs per cycle.

```{r}
v_c_t <- m_M_PSM$trace %*% v_c
v_u_t <- m_M_PSM$trace %*% v_u

tot_c <-  t(v_c_t) %*% v_dw
tot_u <-  t(v_u_t) %*% v_dw

# display results
results <- data.frame(Total_Cost = tot_c, Total_QALYs = tot_u)
results
```
