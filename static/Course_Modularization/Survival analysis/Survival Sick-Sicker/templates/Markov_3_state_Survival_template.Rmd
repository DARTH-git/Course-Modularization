Survival analysis component

```{r}
# load the Sicker data 
data_long <- read.csv() # Your turn
head(data_long)

# Models can be fitted independently for each transition. This is more flexible!

# Create subsets for each transition
data_S1D   <-  # Your turn
data_S1S2  <-  # Your turn

# Fit independent models for each transition and pick one that fits best
fit_S1S2 <- # Your turn
fit_S1D  <- # Your turn

# Find the best-fitting models based on AIC
fit_S1S2$AIC

best_S1D  <- # Your turn

# Calculate the transition probabilities from the best-fitting survival models
p_S1S2 <- # Your turn
p_S1D  <- # Your turn
```

# 04 Define and initialize matrices and vectors

## 04.1 Cohort trace

```{r}
# create the cohort trace
m_M <- matrix(NA, 
              nrow = n_t + 1 ,  # create Markov trace (n.t + 1 because R doesn't 
                                # understand cycle 0)
              ncol = n_states, 
              dimnames = list(0:n_t, v_n))

m_M[1, ] <- v_init          # initialize first cycle of Markov trace
```

## 04.2 Transition probability array

```{r}
# create the transition probability array
a_P <- array(0,                                      # Create 3-D array
             dim = c(n_states, n_states, n_t),
             dimnames = list(v_n, v_n, 0:(n_t - 1))) # name the dimensions of the array 
```

Fill in the transition probability array:

```{r}
# from Sick
a_P["S1", "S1", ]    <-  # Your turn
a_P["S1", "S2", ]    <-  # Your turn
a_P["S1", "D", ]     <-  # Your turn

# from Sicker
a_P["S2", "S2", ] <- 1 - p_S2D
a_P["S2", "D", ]  <- p_S2D

# from Dead
a_P["D", "D", ] <- 1
```

## 04.3 Check if transition array and probabilities are valid

```{r}
# Check that transition probabilities are in [0, 1]
check_transition_probability(a_P, verbose = TRUE)
# Check that all rows sum to 1
check_sum_of_transition_array(a_P, n_states = n_states, n_cycles = n_t, verbose = TRUE)
```

# 05 Run Markov model

```{r}

  m_M[t + 1, ] <- m_M[t, ] %*% a_P[, , t]  # estimate the Markov trace for cycle t + 1 
                                           # using the t-th matrix from the 
                                           # probability array 
}
