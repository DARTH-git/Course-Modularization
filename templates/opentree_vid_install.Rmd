## OpenTree installation

For those we went through the "Getting ready" session of the "Introduction to R for Decision Modeling Module", you would have already downloaded the R package `OpenTree` via:

[Download package-installation R script](../../../Course_Modularization/Intro, general, packages/00_prep.R)

If not, please download the above R script to install all R packages required for this workshop, which includes `OpenTree`.
